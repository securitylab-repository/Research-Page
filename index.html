		<h1>Research</h1> 

		<p> I did my Ph.D. under the supervision of Philippe Gaborit, in the Xlim Laboratory of University of Limoges.
		For my Ph.D., I worked on various aspects of " Security and Privacy" applied to Wireless Networks.</p>

		<p>My general field of research is Privacy and Network Security.
