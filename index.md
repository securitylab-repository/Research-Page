Research
========

I did my Ph.D. under the supervision of Philippe Gaborit, in the Xlim Laboratory of University of Limoges. For my Ph.D., I worked on various aspects of " Security and Privacy" applied to Wireless Networks.

My general field of research is computer and network security. **In particular, I’m working to impove malware analysis and forensic tools, by using machine and deep learning approaches**
